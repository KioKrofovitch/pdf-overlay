pdf-overlay
===========
This python script takes text input from Google Docs spreadsheet and overlays the text at the appropriate location in a government form.

### Google GovDev Hackathon
This script was completed as part of the [Google GovDev Challenge](http://www.govdevchallenge.com/) with team [GovSafe](https://github.com/avantassel/govsafe
).

The hackathon took place from May 17-18 in Denver, Colorado.  We chose to solve [Challenge #1](http://www.govdevchallenge.com/challenge-details/), which aids survivors in efficiently filling out forms at Disaster Assistance Centers.  

Unfortunately, many government "PDF" forms are actually saved as images, making it difficult to automate stepping through and filling out the fields.  This python script allows you overlay text on pre-determined forms, even though they are not in true PDF format.  The text input is pulled down from a Google Docs spreadsheet that is populated as users enter their information via the web.
